        <div style="font-size: 36px;padding-top: 20;color: purple">
            Pretty early save today, but I don't forsee too much happening, and if something does I'll be able to at least get back here if needed. I do have some plans but they aren't really out of the blue plans.
            <br>
            <br>        Get food at some point, maybe go to <span style="color: red">GS1</span> and get some chips; I've been craving Takis as of late for... some reason... so I might leave to go fufill that crave at some point- or I just stay in my room as I depressingly always do. I might do some more avatar shit on my free time, but I also want to hang out with a friend online at some point.
<br><br>        I did fuck up last night and this morning with planning, referring back to the top, but I had told multiple people that my party was today and not JUNE 22nd, 2024 @ 13:00PM by mistake because my mom told me something else. Not to push the blame but... I'm pushing the blame just a little bit. Will be sure to save later when I get the chance, don't want to accidentally skip a day, anything could've happened to me.
