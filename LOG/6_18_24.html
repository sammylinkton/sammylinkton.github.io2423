        <div style="font-size: 36px;padding-top: 20;color: purple">
            Today was a good day today; I had a pretty long day, but it was okay none-than-less. I went to go pick up CB from his home around 20:00; when CB's sister told me "Oh, you and <span style="color: blue">CB</span> are probably gonna fuck, huh?" Weirdly, that keeps popping into my head, mainly because it was just... such an out of pocket thing to say honestly.
<br>
            <br>        When me and <span style="color: blue">CB</span> got home, I watched him play games for a couple of hours, then we both got hungry at 01:00. We made the (not-so) courageous decision to drive 45 minutes to a <span style="color: red">McD</span> in <span style="color: green">LOC 1</span>. After we had gotten our food, we had decided that since it was really fresh and not going to be so fresh when we made it home, to go eat in the parking lot, but we had made a weird decision while sitting.
<br>
<br>        We had opened up all of our doors and windows, even the hood, just because we wanted to see what would happen. I hadn't really opened my mind to being... "free" from anything till <span style="color: blue">CB</span> showed me what there was to do if I just opened up once in a while. It felt really nice. We made it back home and now we are about to sleep.
