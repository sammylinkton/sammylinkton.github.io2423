            Today is good, I woke up around 6, then around 10:45ish to my dad waking me up. My grandpa wanted to show me a waterfall and it was really pretty, I’m sure the full image is in the source somewhere. But seriously, it was amazing. I’ll have to show <span style="color:blue">CB</span> this place at some point. I’m sure he’d love it.

We are currently getting gas and then Wdys, then hopefully back home. I’ll have to make him a profile soon, I’m probably going to make it <span style="font-style: italic">ST</span> because, well, that is his name. This icon for the save will be really pretty for sure. Sorry there isn't too much today; just not that eventful.
